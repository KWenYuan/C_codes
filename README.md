# C_codes
I am using this repository as a place where I will apply the things that I have learnt in school here

It is just a simple projects for me to see and refer to. The code is simple to understand and code but it is a good learning experience for me do it from scratch.

The code may not be the most efficient but it will work

Currently have:

+ **reverse.c** - Function to reverse an array
+ **minmax.c** - Function to find the Min and Max value in an array
